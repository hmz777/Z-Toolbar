# Z-Toolbar
A simple productivity toolbar written in C# and WPF.

I have mainly written this tool because i ran out of space in the Windows taskbar and since taskbar icons can be accessed from anywhere with no need to minimize your workspace to access desktop icons (for example),
i created this tool to pin more icons than can be accessed easily from anywhere.

# Features
- The toolbar doesn't occupy any screen real estate because it resides off screen and only shown when the mouse pointer reaches the middle of the top edge of the screen.
- It supports adding files and folders.
- Easy and fast way to remove icons from the list by clicking the `Edit` button.
- The app doesn't have a taskbar icon, it has only a tray icon which can be used to close it (in addition to the exit button on the main window).

# Misc
- The app register it self in the windows registery in order to run at startup (if the checkbox was checked).
- Items are saved as a JSON file in the app directory.

# Upcoming Features
- I will add a docking feature in order to dock the toolbar in different directions on screen.
- Sorting and filtering of items in the list.
- The ability to move icons freely in order to sort them in any way.
